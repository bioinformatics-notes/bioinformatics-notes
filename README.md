# Bioinformatics Notes

This repository contains structured notes, explanations and small examples related to bioinformatics and computational biology.

It is intended as a learning and reference space documenting my progression from a wet-lab and clinical biochemistry background into computational analysis.

## Background

I am a clinical biochemist with experience in hospital laboratory workflows, quality control and data interpretation, currently completing an MSc in Personalised Medicine.

My interest lies in applying computational methods to biologically and clinically meaningful questions.

## Scope of this repository

Topics may include:
- Core bioinformatics concepts
- Data types used in biology and medicine
- R and Python notes for biological data analysis
- Explanations of methods in my own words
- Small worked examples using public or simulated data

This repository focuses on understanding and interpretation rather than optimised or production-level code.

## Structure (will evolve)

- `notes/` – conceptual notes and explanations
- `examples/` – small illustrative analyses
- `resources/` – links, papers, and learning material

## Disclaimer

This is a learning repository. Content may change as my understanding develops.
