# Biomarker Exploration – Interpretation

This example uses simulated clinical-style data to explore the distribution of a continuous biomarker.

## Observations

- The biomarker values follow an approximately normal distribution, as expected given the simulation method.
- Visual inspection of the histogram suggests no extreme skewness or outliers.
- Boxplots stratified by sex show broadly similar distributions between groups, with overlapping medians and interquartile ranges.

## Interpretation

In a real clinical dataset, this type of exploratory analysis would be used to:
- Assess data quality and distribution
- Identify potential outliers or batch effects
- Decide whether parametric or non-parametric methods are appropriate
- Explore whether stratification variables (e.g. sex) may need to be considered in downstream analysis

This example demonstrates basic exploratory data analysis rather than formal hypothesis testing.
