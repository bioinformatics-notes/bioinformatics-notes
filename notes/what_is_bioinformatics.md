# What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that applies computational, statistical and data-driven approaches to biological questions.

In practice, it involves managing, analysing and interpreting large or complex biological datasets that cannot be handled manually.

## Why bioinformatics is necessary

Modern biology generates large volumes of data, including:
- DNA and RNA sequencing data
- Proteomics and metabolomics datasets
- Clinical and phenotypic data
- Imaging and high-throughput assay results

Bioinformatics provides the tools to extract meaningful patterns from these datasets and to connect raw measurements to biological or clinical insight.

## Bioinformatics vs computational biology

The terms are often used interchangeably, but they can differ slightly:

- **Bioinformatics** often focuses on data handling, pipelines and applied analysis of biological datasets.
- **Computational biology** may place more emphasis on modelling, theory and hypothesis-driven computation.

In reality, most research combines aspects of both.

## Relevance to personalised medicine

In personalised medicine, bioinformatics enables:
- Stratification of patient populations
- Identification of biomarkers
- Integration of multi-omics data
- Data-driven treatment decisions

This makes computational approaches essential for translating biological data into clinical application.
